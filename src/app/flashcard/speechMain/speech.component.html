        <h2> What is speech?</h2>
        <p>Speech is how we say sounds and words. Speech may vary based on region, inheritance, culture etc.
          It's normal for children to say some sounds incorrectly. Some sounds don’t develop until 4 to 6 years.
          Sometimes, Speech therapy may help with speech or language  development.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Language?</h2>
        <p>Language is made up of the words or signs we use to share ideas, needs or thoughts. Language includes
          speaking, understanding, reading and writing.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Speech or language development in children</h2>
        <p>Speech development is a natural process that starts before the birth of the baby.
          The fetus starts recognizing the sounds of its mother. Later in life it becomes an essential
          part of day to day activities. It helps to express emotion, thoughts and needs. It eases human
          life to survive in the current world. Speech enables us to do many things but most important for
          following mundane activities:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>  Express emotion, thoughts and needs</li>
            <li>  Build relationship with family and friends</li>
            <li>  Interact and learn</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>How to encourage speech development in children?</h2>
        <p>Speech development is a gradual process. The basic and best way to start this process is to
          talk to your child a lot on a daily basis, no matter what age. There are many ways to encourage
          speech or language development in children.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Talk to the child</strong></li>
                <p>You can start talking to your child from birth. You can talk to them about any topic even if
                  they are not responding. Engage them with some words and sounds. Ask them some questions, like
                  do you wanna play, wanna go outside, etc.</p>

          <li><strong>Make sounds</strong></li>
                <p>Once your child starts making sounds like coo, gurgle etc, make sounds with them.
                  You can encourage them by making sounds in front of them.</p>

          <li><strong>Show lips and tongue movements</strong></li>
                <p>Children grasp quickly by seeing. Encourage your child to say words by showing the lips and
                  tongue movement while saying the words like mumma, pap pa, dad da etc.</p>

          <li><strong>Read books</strong></li>
                <p>Reading books with children helps to learn many words by looking at the pictures. It helps
                  to remember the words quickly. They can correlate the words in real life as well.</p>

          <li><strong>Flash cards</strong></li>
                <p>Flash cards are an easy way to increase the vocabulary of the kids. It helps to remember the
                  words. Continuous and repetition of flash cards help to improve speech development.</p>
        </ol>

        <h2>What's the speech development milestone?</h2>
        <p>Speech development is a natural process although the ages and stages of children’s speech development
          differ from child to child with time. However, there are some milestones which help to identify the
          normal speech development in the kids.These milestones can help parents if they need to spend extra
          time with kids on speech development.
        </p>
        Speech development milestones can be classified as :

        <h2> What is Speech therapy?</h2>
        <p>Speech therapy is the process of assessment and treatment of speech and language
          problems by Speech specialists. It helps children and adults to speak clearly.
        </p>

        <h2>How can parents do Speech therapy activities at home?</h2>
        <p>There are many activities that parents can do at home which helps to improve
          speech development. These activities are selected according to the age of the children.
          Top five activities apply to all age groups.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>  <strong>Flashcards
          </strong>
          <p>
            Parents can use the digital flashcards to motivate children to speak the words.
            Pictures and sounds  help to remember the words. Parents should say the words loud
            and clear, it motivates children to imitate sounds of the words.
          </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Talking
          </strong>
            <p>
              Talking to children is a magical thing in speech therapy. Ideally, you should be
              talking to your child from birth. You can talk to them about any topic even if they
              are not responding. Engage them with some words and sounds.
            </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Reading books
          </strong>
            <p>
              Reading age appropriate books aloud with children helps to learn many words by
              looking at pictures. You can describe the pictures and objects with some hypothetical
              stories which may interest your children.
            </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Making silly noise

          </strong>
            <p>
              Making silly noise helps to articulate the sounds. It helps to do some exercise
              which makes the mouth flexible. These facial exercises help to practise some words.
            </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Singing and music

          </strong>
            <p>
              Singing and music encourages children to speak. Rhymes help to remember some words.
              These days we have an abundance of catchy rhymes like Twinkle Twinkle little star,
              Five little monkeys jumping on the bed, wheels on the bus going round n round etc.
            </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Blowing bubbles

          </strong>
            <p>
              Blowing bubbles is a way to do facial exercise. It strengthens the mouth muscles
              which are responsible for making speech sounds.

            </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Blowing air in balloons

          </strong>
            <p>
              Blowing air in balloons is another way to do facial exercise. It eases the mouth
              muscles to articulate sounds and words with regular practice.
            </p></li>
          <li>  <strong>Limit screen time and play outside
          </strong>
            <p>
              We are surrounded by gadgets. Unlike adults, children are not aware that
              these gadgets have adverse effects on their mental and physical development.
              Speech development is also hampered if we expose children to excessive
              screen time. Parents should manage the usage of gadgets or devices with
              optimum control. On the other hand, we should play with kids outside in the backyard or park.
            </p></li>

        <h2>What are the early signs of speech, language and hearing disorders?</h2>
        <p>Each child has his own development rate. Some children are proactive and do
          activities earlier than others. Similarly some children start talking earlier
          than others, it depends on various factors, personal or environmental factors
          like your interaction with the child, number of children at home, nuclear or
          joint family, work schedule etc. Parents should consistently refer to the speech
          development milestones with respect to appropriate age to know if the children
          are lagging behind. Please refer more for early disorder detection
          <a href="https://www.asha.org/public/early-identification-of-speech-language-and-hearing-disorders">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that some kids are late bloomers. They take some more time
          compared to others to kick start the speech development.</p>


        <h2>When to check with your child's doctor?</h2>
        <p>You know your child best. If you have any concerns about your child’s language
          development, ask your General Practitioner (GP) or paediatrician. They might refer you
          to a speech pathologist or specialist.</p>
